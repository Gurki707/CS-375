Some websites that I find interesting include: NORAD Tracks Santa Links it is a 
example of WebGL using GIS information but I found it interesting because 
I grew up using this website as a way to follow Santa Claus when I was younger.

Another example of WebGL I found interesting was Shadertoy because I like how a program language 
can be used to show art and how it is a tool for creating shaders through WebGL.
