# Project Overview - 

For this project, I will create an Interactive 3D Dice Roller using Three.js. The application will allow users to roll a 3D die by clicking a button, with realistic rolling animations, lighting, and textures.


# Project Schedule - 

Week 1 - Research and find dice face textures (1-6 numbers).

Week 2 - Apply textures to the cube to represent the die and apply a simple texture or color.

Week 3 - Implement rolling animations, use random rotations and bouncing physics for the die, and write logic to determine the face of the die when it stops.

Week 4 - Finalize and test: Prepare the project presentation.

# Project Technical Requirements - 

I intend to use Three.js for rendering and animations and JavaScript for logic and user interactions.
